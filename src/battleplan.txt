Economic Unit (called... an agent?)
    - $$ in bank
    - Resources wanted
    - Emergency fund
    - Resources produced (for an individual, it's labor)

If an agent can make a profit from trading (cost of moving resources + cost of trader < arbitrage) it does so.
A # of random pops consider trading between their province and another one
    (random, weighted by low distance and high pops).

ACTUALLY, trade routes need only originate from nodes with high pops. (Trade centers!)
AND, you could have multi-legged trade routes (trade from small province to big province, then between regions, then from big to small)
OUTGOING TRADE ROUTE LENGTH IS PROPORTIONAL TO HOME NODE POPS.

Actually, trade route length should be proportional to the lesser population of the two end cities.
That way, large cities don't trade directly with tiny villages halfway across the globe.

Truthfully, the deciding factor over whether a trade route is started isn't population, it's trading infrastructure,
which is itself a result of profitability. Rural mines and rural factories should be able to trade.
It's complicated, and I'm sure any economist will tell you that it's complicated.
But population is a good initial proxy.

    Each agent puts its resources on the local market
